# Slack Image Presentation Challenge:
This is my approach to Slack's Intern Technical Challenge for their Summer 2016 prospective interns.

### The Challenge:
Create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title.

* The ability to access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
* The ability to display that data on a page;
* The ability to update the UI of a page without refreshing; and
* The ability to do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery).

#### My Response:
Yaaay Vanilla.js, the pain is real without JavaScript libraries, new found respect for libraries. Found an open photo API with a search functionality. Rather it is actually a clothing API (Zalando), but its full text search along with images is rather idea.
